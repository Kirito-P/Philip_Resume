<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I have been in sales for most of my life & have been wanting to work full-time in web development and design. 
        I have studied a few web development courses through Udemy Academy & Intec. I am considering studying more courses and always wanting to learn something new.

        I am always willing to broaden my knowledge and skills. I enjoy troubleshooting when met with unforeseen challenges. In my current role as IT Support, 
        I handle various requests and come up with solutions to problems I have not encountered before. I manage various orders in my current role, 
        i.e. from creating a quote to concluding the orders. It is my responsibility to ensure that orders are delivered to customers timeously. 
        This has enhanced my time management and projects. When the system needs updating I have to use HTML /CSS to update any information required on the CRM system, 
        which plays an important role from the e-commerce aspect. 
        The above are all important factors which have assisted me to grow from strength to strength in my career.
